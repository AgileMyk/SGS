                    <h2>The Messiah Will Rise from Death</h2>

                    <h4>Psalm 16:8-11; Acts 2:30-32</h4>

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Psalm 16:8-11
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have set the LORD always before me;
                        because he is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices;
                        my flesh also dwells secure.
                        <br>
                    For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol,
                        or let your holy one see corruption.
                        <br> 
                    You make known to me the path of life;
                        in your presence there is fullness of joy;
                        at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
                        <br>
                    In rabbinic tradition, there was discussion as to whether David was speaking of immortality in Psalm 
                    16.  What exactly is David expressing when he describes the hopes he has in this Psalm? The 
                    corruption spoken of in this psalm refers literally to “the pit”; he believed he would not undergo 
                    physical decay. Clearly, David succumbed to this, as will be addressed in the Apostle’s use of these 
                    Scriptures. So what in sense is he speaking of not seeing decay, if he ultimately died? There is a 
                    popular Jewish Song that sings “David, Melech Yisrael, chai, chai, v’kayam,” “David, King of Israel, 
                    lives forever” (or “lives and endures”). Jews for Jesus uses this example to make a point when they 
                    highlight a conversation that took place in light of these lyrics: An online poster (using an 
                    alternative spelling for David) posed this question to a Jewish discussion group: “I’m pretty sure 
                    David, the king of Israel is dead and buried. If so, what does this song really mean and why do we 
                    sing it?” One answer given was: “Perhaps since the messiah is to be from the lineage of King David 
                    and has yet to come, it is a reference of things to come via King David’s line and a continuation?”
                    <br> 
                    In Acts 2 and in Acts 13 this section of Scripture is addressed.
                    <br> 
                    “Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set 
                    one of his descendants on his throne, he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the [Messiah], 
                    that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God raised up, and 
                    of that we all are witnesses.”
                    –Acts 2:30-32
                    <br>
                    But God raised him from the dead and for many days he appeared to those who had come up with him from 
                    Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.  And we bring you the good news that 
                    what God promised to the fathers, this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus, as 
                    also it is written in the second Psalm,
                    <br>
                    “‘You are my Son,
                        today I have begotten you.’
                        <br>
                    And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken 
                    in this way,
                    <br>
                    “‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.’
                    Therefore he says also in another psalm,
                    “‘You will not let your Holy One see corruption.’
                    <br>
                    For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid 
                    with his fathers and saw corruption, but he whom God raised up did not see corruption.
                    <br> 
                    In Acts chapter 13, Paul argues similarly. David did see (that is, experience) that corruption of 
                    death, because, after all, he died. But it was in his own descendant, the Messiah Jesus, that 
                    corruption was not seen. As Paul taught elsewhere, because of Jesus’ resurrection, the resurrection 
                    of all other believers is possible.
                    <br> 
                    David looked ahead to a life with God beyond the grave, even if he did not have full clarity of what 
                    that entailed. Because Jesus’ resurrection enables the resurrection of all believers, including 
                    David, that vision of his own resurrection merged with the resurrection of Jesus.
                    <br> 
                    In an ultimate sense, David would not see corruption, as he would in his final state, be redeemed 
                    and destined to live for eternity in a glorified body with the God of glory.
